    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An object's moment of inertia acts as a component used to calculate torque\n",
    "required to accelerate the object around a selected pivot point. Across this lab\n",
    "we intend to apply this concept alongside the idea behind torque to determine\n",
    "properties of an object, and refine our understanding of how moment of inertia,\n",
    "the radius of an object and the position of an objects mass will impact the\n",
    "resulting torque required to achieve a desired angular velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment we intend to complete several runs to ensure quality data is gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attach the mass to the end of the string, measure the radius of the axle.\n",
    "1. Calculate the circumference of the axle.\n",
    "1. Calculate length of the string coiled around the axle by multiplying the\n",
    "   number of rotations by the circumference.\n",
    "1. Release the mass and measure the time for the falling mass to hit the ground\n",
    "   using a stopwatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for the tension force of the string connecting the mass to the platter\n",
    "axle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum F = T - mg = ma $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T = m(g+a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the torque this forces exerts on the axle of radius $r$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tau = rT\\sin(\\theta) = rm(g+a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Relating this to the moment of inertia of the platter and object using Newton's second law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tau = I\\alpha $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ rm(g+a) = (I_P + I_M) \\frac{a}{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for the moment of inertia of the platter and object:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{r^2m(g+a)}{a} = I_P + I_M = I $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $I_M$ is ignored for this problem since $I_P$ is what is being found.\n",
    "For the experiment, we calculate acceleration from the time it takes the mass to\n",
    "fall a certain distance $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{r^2m \\left(\\frac{gt^2}{2d} + 1\\right) = I_P} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure $d$ using a number of wraps around the axle of rotation of radius\n",
